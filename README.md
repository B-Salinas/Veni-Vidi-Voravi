## Primary Components 
- User authentication is handled using bcryptjs library for password hashing.
- Only grants access to features like creating and editing stories to authorized users.
- Designed around a relational database schema, which allows users to create, edit, clap, and comment on stories with dynamic data and rendering.
- Makes use of AJAX / API Routes to render elements such as clapping asynchronously.
- Includes csrf attack protection and performs front-end and back-end validation on forms

## Code Highlights / Challenges 
- We quickly found a huge bug dealing with storing cookies ‚Äî when a user logged in and rerouted themselves back to welcome page that only logged out users can access, we were left hanging after trying to log back in (even though we never logged out).

## Future Implementations 
 - Topics / Categories / Tags
- Bookmarks
- Claps on comments
- Filtering Stories
- Display Followers/Following List on Profile Page
